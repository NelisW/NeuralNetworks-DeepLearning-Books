    "\n",
    "    The same basic widget is used several times, in slightly different\n",

    "    bugs if one is not careful to keep the code in sync, so I have\n",
    "    separated the code into two pieces.\n",

    "    The first piece is the header code.  This changes between widgets.\n",

    "    and so on -- things which may vary betweens widgets.\n",
    "\n",
    "    The second piece is the body code.  This is almost exactly the same\n",
    "    for the different widgets.  Note, however, that the costGraphX and\n",
    "    epochX variables change name, due to a bug in the way paperjs\n",
    "    handles scope.\n",
    "\n",
    "    We can make these changes by searching on costGraph1 and replacing\n",
    "    with costGraph2, costGraph3 etc, by replacing epoch1 with epoch2,\n",
    "    epoch3 etc, and by replcacing cost1 with cost2, cost3 etc.\n",
