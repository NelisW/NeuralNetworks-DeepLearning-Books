This brief description is taken from \cite{DEAPGitHub2019}.

DEAP is a novel evolutionary computation framework for rapid prototyping and testing of ideas. It seeks to make algorithms explicit and data structures transparent. It works in perfect harmony with parallelisation mechanisms such as multiprocessing and SCOOP \cite{SCOOPDocs2019}.

DEAP includes the following features:
\begin{enumerate}
\item Genetic algorithm using any imaginable representation
\begin{enumerate}
\item List, Array, Set, Dictionary, Tree, Numpy Array, etc.
\end{enumerate}
\item Genetic programing using prefix trees
\begin{enumerate}
\item Loosely typed, Strongly typed
\item Automatically defined functions
\end{enumerate}
\item Evolution strategies (including CMA-ES)
\item Multi-objective optimisation (NSGA-II, SPEA2, MO-CMA-ES)
\item Co-evolution (cooperative and competitive) of multiple populations
\item Parallelization of the evaluations (and more)
\item Hall of Fame of the best individuals that lived in the population
\item Checkpoints that take snapshots of a system regularly
\item Benchmarks module containing most common test functions
\item Genealogy of an evolution (that is compatible with NetworkX)
\item Examples of alternative algorithms : Particle Swarm Optimization, Differential Evolution, Estimation of Distribution Algorithm

\end{enumerate}
