Input data can be be widely varying, some form of normalisation is required to ``pull'' the inputs into the same range, so that the large values don't dominate the smaller values.  

One of the standard techniques is to scale each set of input data independently to a mean value of zero and a unit variance.
Scikit-Learn's \lstinline{StandardScaler} can do this for you.
