# Neural Networks and Deep Learning Notes

This repository serves to capture my notes on Machine Learning.  It containst Michael Nielsen's book as Part I, my own notes in Part II, and some more information from diverse sources in Part III.

My LaTeX conversion of Nielsen's book, is done to force me to read carefully.  When I asked Michael Nielsen for permission to do this, he replied that  *''the book is written under a CC-BY-NC license. That means you can adapt it, provided you attribute, and it's not for commercial purposes (e.g., you can't make money from it - if you want to, then we'll need to talk licensing).''* 
This work therefore has to remain under the same license, whatever you want to do with it. Nielsen used version 3 of the license. Version 4 is used here.
Part I of this book is not authorised by Michael Nielsen, the authoritative version remains the HTML page at http://neuralnetworksanddeeplearning.com/.

The book is formatted using Tufte-LaTeX, a document format based on the work of Edward Tufte.

This is a work in progress, it will be updated from time to time. For this reason the PDF is not committed, you can build it yourself using MikTeX or TexLive.
