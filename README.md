# Nielsen-NeuralNetworks-DeepLearning
My LaTeX conversion of Nielsen's book, done to force me to read carefully.  The idea is to add my own notes to the book as I learn.

When I asked Michael Nielson for permission to do his, he replied that ''the book is written under a CC-BY-NC license. That means you can adapt it, provided you attribute, and it's not for commercial purposes (e.g., you can't make money from it - if you want to, then we'll need to talk licensing).''  This work has to remain under the same license, whatever you want to do with this.

This LaTeX version and the PDF made from it is not authorised by Michael Nielson, the authoritative version remains the HTML page at http://neuralnetworksanddeeplearning.com/.

This is a work in progress, it will be updated from time to time. For this reason the PDF is not committed, you can build it yourself.
